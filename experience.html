        <h2>My Aims</h2>
        <p>The majority of my professional experience has been working outside, deep in nature, or working with machines inside. Computers have received an equal amount of my focus but never professionally. I am very mechanically minded and highly logical. These attributes have lended themselves nicely to being able to troubleshoot and repair complex machinery and electronics in my current position. As well as in my early years as a highly skilled and internationally certified Arborist and Tree Risk Assessor.</p>
        <p>Logic and problem solving have always been my strong suits and something that I have always tried to have present in my daily tasks. I feel that programming is going to fit nicely .</p>
