        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>I am a Portland native. I grew up owning the streets on my 10-speed and listening to the Mortal Kombat Major Motion Picture soundtrack on my bright yellow, waterproof Walkman. I spent the majority of my teen years building PCs and learning how to remote control all of the home computers of my friends families. Don’t tell anyone I told you that. I graduated with pretty middle of the road grades and SAT scores to totally make up for the GPA. I went to the University of Nevada Las Vegas and sometimes attended the University of Nevada Las Vegas. I have been working in small businesses my entire adult life and greatly appreciate working on a team.</p><br>
        <p>I have always had my eyes on computers and am happy to be making it a little more formal. I mean, sometimes playing CounterStrike got pretty formal…</p>

        <h2>My Aims</h2>
        <p>I am very excited to be here at Treehouse. I plan on spending the next few months building up as strong of a foundation of HTML, CSS and JS that I can. My goal is to focus very hard on JS for quite some time, building up a proficiency in a few different frameworks. My hope is to master React and Vue as I feel there will be some sort of longevity in positions utilizing these frameworks.</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React/Vue</li>
          <li>jsNode</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I also want to work on being highly skilled in jsNode to better understand the other workings of JS. My long term aim is to get into Machine Learning, but this is merely a thought at this point. Some exposure into that world will show me if it is truely what I want.</p>
